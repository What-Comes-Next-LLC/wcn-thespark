# The Spark

*Transformation begins with The Spark.*

The Spark is the first mobile app in the Catalyst ecosystem — a minimalist, behavior-first tool designed to help users begin their health journey by doing one simple thing:  
**Take a picture of your food.**

No calorie counting. No shame. No fake AI assistant.  
Just one moment of intention — a Spark — captured.

## 💡 Project Vision

**The Spark** is more than a meal logger. It is the entry point to a privacy-first, trainer-guided, AI-enhanced health platform.

We believe that sustainable change starts not with knowledge, but with *attention.*  
By capturing meals in real time, we begin building a **longitudinal, visual record** of human behavior — personalized, private, and powerful.

As the platform evolves, these logs will feed a secure, user-specific system capable of:

- Identifying patterns in meal timing, content, and context  
- Suggesting personalized pantry builds from recurring ingredients  
- Generating “Day in the Life” mosaics and reflections  
- Supporting trainers with contextualized coaching dashboards  
- Creating progress narratives unique to each user’s journey  

All of this will happen without sharing or selling user data.  
The Catalyst system is a **locally-hosted, privacy-centered alternative** to traditional cloud-based health trackers.

## 🔒 Philosophy

> "We don’t coach with fear. We coach with patterns.  
> We don’t predict your behavior. We help you reflect on it."

The Spark is about giving users control — over their data, their habits, and their growth.  
Everything we build will respect that ethos.
