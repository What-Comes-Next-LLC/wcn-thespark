## Architecture Notes

### Authentication Implementation (2024-04-24)
- Authentication is handled entirely through Supabase within the app
- No direct interaction with the host site (whatcomesnextllc.ai) for authentication
- WebView bridge handles communication between native and web content
- Supabase instance provides independent authentication layer
- This architecture allows for:
  - Independent authentication flow
  - No CORS configuration needed
  - No dependency on host site configuration
  - Secure token management through local storage
