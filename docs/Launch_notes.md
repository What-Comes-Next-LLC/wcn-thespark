# The Spark Mobile App Launch Notes

## Project Overview
The Spark is a mobile wrapper for the-catalyst-deck, providing a secure, offline-capable experience for food logging and health tracking. This document tracks the implementation progress and key decisions during development.

## Architecture Notes

### Authentication Implementation (2024-04-24, 22:00)
- Authentication is handled entirely through Supabase within the app
- No direct interaction with the host site (whatcomesnextllc.ai) for authentication
- WebView bridge handles communication between native and web content
- Supabase instance provides independent authentication layer
- This architecture allows for:
  - Independent authentication flow
  - No CORS configuration needed
  - No dependency on host site configuration
  - Secure token management through local storage

### Progress Update (2024-04-24, 22:00)
Completed:
- ✅ Basic Android app structure with Capacitor
- ✅ Authentication UI with branded styling
- ✅ WebView bridge for native-web communication
- ✅ Secure storage service for tokens
- ✅ Supabase configuration and URL settings
- ✅ Logo integration and branding implementation

Current Status:
- Supabase authentication is configured and ready for testing
- URL configurations verified:
  - Site URL: https://whatcomesnextllc.ai
  - Redirect URLs properly configured for all required protocols
  - WebView local file access paths set correctly

Next Steps:
1. Build and test authentication flow
2. Verify token storage and retrieval
3. Test redirection to /log endpoint
4. Validate session persistence

Technical Implementation Details:
- Using local WebView for authentication UI
- Supabase client handles auth operations
- Token-based session management
- Secure local storage for credentials
- Native-web bridge communication established
