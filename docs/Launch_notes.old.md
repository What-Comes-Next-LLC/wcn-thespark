# The Spark Mobile App Launch Notes

## Project Overview
The Spark is a mobile wrapper for the-catalyst-deck, providing a secure, offline-capable experience for food logging and health tracking. This document tracks the implementation progress and key decisions during development.

## Architecture Notes

### Authentication Implementation (2024-04-24, 22:00)
- Authentication is handled entirely through Supabase within the app
- No direct interaction with the host site (whatcomesnextllc.ai) for authentication
- WebView bridge handles communication between native and web content
- Supabase instance provides independent authentication layer
- This architecture allows for:
  - Independent authentication flow
  - No CORS configuration needed
  - No dependency on host site configuration
  - Secure token management through local storage

### Authentication Implementation Update (2024-04-24, 23:45)
- Identified pattern of unintentional auth strategy drift
- Three instances of deviating from established .env-based Supabase authentication:
  1. Initial WebView-only implementation attempt
  2. Loss of auth-service.js during refactoring
  3. Recent attempt to hardcode credentials and modify module structure
- Reaffirming commitment to:
  - Environment variable-based configuration
  - Supabase as authentication source of truth
  - Maintaining established module structure
  - Proper separation of development/production credentials

Next Immediate Steps:
1. Rollback recent auth changes
2. Verify .env configuration
3. Test complete authentication flow
4. Proceed with styling once auth is verified

Technical Implementation Details:
- Using local WebView for authentication UI
- Supabase client handles auth operations
- Token-based session management
- Secure local storage for credentials
- Native-web bridge communication established

### Progress Update (2024-04-24, 22:00)
Completed:
- ✅ Basic Android app structure with Capacitor
- ✅ Authentication UI with branded styling
- ✅ WebView bridge for native-web communication
- ✅ Secure storage service for tokens
- ✅ Supabase configuration and URL settings
- ✅ Logo integration and branding implementation

### Architectural Decision Point (2024-04-24, 23:15)
Key Decision: Transition to Supabase as source of truth for authentication across platforms

Current Implementation Context:
- Web app (/log) uses simple Airtable-based user management
- Mobile app implements Supabase authentication
- Need for unified authentication approach

Strategic Benefits:
- Single source of truth for user authentication
- Modern, secure authentication patterns
- Future-proof architecture for cross-platform expansion
- Clean migration path from current implementation

Immediate Scope (Mobile Implementation):
1. User Creation & Onboarding
   - Simple form matching current flow
   - Basic user data collection
   - Supabase account creation

2. Authentication Flow
   - Login with created credentials
   - Token management
   - Session handling

3. Basic Logger Implementation
   - Photo capture/upload
   - Success/return flow
   - Basic personalization

Future Integration Points (Noted but Not Implemented):
- User schema compatibility
- Token structure standardization
- Data format consistency
- Success/return flow patterns
- Next.js web integration
- Airtable to Supabase migration

Next Build/Test Milestone:
- Implementation of "Create Account" flow
- Basic onboarding form
- Simple logger view
- End-to-end flow testing

This focused scope ensures delivery of core mobile functionality while maintaining awareness of future platform integration needs.

Current Status:
- Supabase authentication is configured and ready for testing
- URL configurations verified:
  - Site URL: https://whatcomesnextllc.ai
  - Redirect URLs properly configured for all required protocols
  - WebView local file access paths set correctly

Next Steps:
1. Build and test authentication flow
2. Verify token storage and retrieval
3. Test redirection to /log endpoint
4. Validate session persistence

Technical Implementation Details:
- Using local WebView for authentication UI
- Supabase client handles auth operations
- Token-based session management
- Secure local storage for credentials
- Native-web bridge communication established
